# SGE (Version 0.3)
A simple Python game engine used for creating simple 2D games.  It is built on the Python Turtle module.

## Overview:

The purpose of the Simple Game Engine is to give beginning Python coders a simple framework to make basic 2D games.  It is intended as an alternative to Pygame. As it is built on the Turtle module, it has the same features and limitations of that module. It does not require any external libraries to be added.
